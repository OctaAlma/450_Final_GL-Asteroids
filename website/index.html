            <ul>
                <li class="desc"><b>Dynamic Keyframes • </b> 
                    This core goal of the project was to implement dynamic keyframing. 
                    In assignment 1, we implemented keyframes that were set at compile time. 
                    The position of these keyframes depend on factors such as the position and velocity of the ship at the moment the animation was triggered. 
                    These factors will affect the time it takes to complete the animation, as well as the position of the ship once the animation is finished.

                <li class="desc"><b>Particle Effects • </b>
                    I also decided to implement a particle system to better convey the actions and events of the game. 
                    Particles are generated whenever the ship accelerates in the forward direction. 
                    As the particle approaches the end of its lifespan, its color transitions from a deep red to a light yellow.
                    <br><br>
                    Particles are also created whenever the asteroids are destroyed. An "explosion" can be seen following the collision of a beam and an asteroid.
                    If the ship collides with an asteroid and it has no more lives left, the ship will explode as well.
                    <br><br>
                    My explosion system was adapted from the <code>Particle</code> class provided for <a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/sueda/courses/CSCE450/2023F/labs/L06/index.html">Lab 6</a>, which uses <code>GL_POINTS</code> drawn as "billboarded" quads.
                </li>
                
                <li class="desc"><b>Collision Detection • </b>
                    Collisions are managed through bounding spheres for both the asteroids and the spaceship. 
                    When initialized, each asteroid has a predetermined radius that is used to calculate the size of its hitbox. 
                    Continuous sphere-to-sphere collisions are performed for the spaceship and all of the asteroids. 
                    Laser beams are represented internally by line segments, and line intersections are performed to check if they collide with any asteroids while they are "active".  
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="screenshot">
                        <img src="./BoundingBoxes.png">
                    </div>    
                    Whenever the hitbox of an asteroid overlaps with the hitbox of the spaceship, the spaceship either explodes or takes "damage" in the form of a life.
